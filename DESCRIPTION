Description: Provides raster grid logic, operations that describe a discretized rectangular domain and 
 don't require access to materialized data. Grids are arrays with dimension and extent, and many operations 
 are functions of just the dimension 'nrows', 'ncols' or a combination of the dimension and the extent 
 'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax'. Here we provide direct access to this logic without need for connection 
 to any materialized data or formats. Grid logic includes functions that relate the cell index to
 row and column, or row and column to cell index, row, column or cell index to position.
