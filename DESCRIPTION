Description: Provides raster grid logic, the grid operations that don't require access to materialized data, i.e. most of them. 
 Grids are arrays with dimension and extent, and many operations are functions of just the dimension 'nrows', 'ncols' or 
 a combination of the dimension and the extent 'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax'. Here we provide direct access to this logic
 without need for connection to any materialized data or formats. Grid logic includes functions that relate the cell index to
 row and column, or row and column to cell index, row, column or cell index to position. Cell index, and row,column posiiton
 exist independently of any other use of a raster grid.
